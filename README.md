Simple Movie Database Browser

The user can search for movies from IMDB using the omdbapi.

This was developed in 1 hour. If I had more time, I would have pooled a small number of the movie result panels (enough to cover the scroll view) instead of instatiating all the result panels. This would be more effiecnt as the program would reuse panels as the user is scrolling through. I would have also create a panel on the side of the window that would display the infomation of the movies when the movie thumbnails are pressed.
